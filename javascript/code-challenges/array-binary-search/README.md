## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

Our approach was breaking down the problem into smaller steps, we knew that we had to split the array in two somehow and insert an number in the middle of it the tough part was knowing what to do without methods.
