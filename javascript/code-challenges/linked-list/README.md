# Linked list
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Node
Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.
Linked List
Create a Linked List class
Within your Linked List class, include a head property.
Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created.
The class should contain the following methods
insert
Arguments: value
Returns: nothing
Adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.
includes
Arguments: value
Returns: Boolean
Indicates whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.
to string
Arguments: none
Returns: a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
Approach was write out a function with console logs and then run tests to see where I stood in relativity to the answers that I was trying to get.
